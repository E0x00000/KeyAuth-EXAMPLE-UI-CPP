# KeyAuth-EXAMPLE-UI

An individually funded project created from nothing using C++ which has the same functionality as the original KeyAuth API, but has been designed to be more easily modifiable and have a simpler implementation. 
It already has ImGui (DX11) integrated into it.
This can be directly utilized in loaders/auth panels and does not require further installation. Present Features:   - API initialize   - Login/Register/Upgrade   - License only authenticated
- User info pulling - Handling basic states The intent is to provide everything that was available with the first API over time keeping the same structure while being clean and adaptable.
- More intuitive design   
- Simple to add new features   
- Customizable from top to bottom   
- Includes both ImGui and DX11 implementations

#  Upcoming Tasks:   
 
- Improve data structures, state management   
- Refactor and optimize response flow
- Add direct file download support from their API
- Implement remaining original API features
